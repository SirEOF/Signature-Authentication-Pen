# Signature-Authentication-Pen

This responsory is for IOT project Signature Authentication Pen

## Introdution

In this project, we designed a Signature Authentication Pen, which realizes identity authentication by exploiting the signature biometric features of the users. Our Signature Authentication Pen collects the acceleration and angular velocity data when the user is writing, and build machine learning model for real time identity prediction. As the biometric features of writing is hard to imitate, our system is much safer compared with traditional identity authentication methods. Our project provides a new approach for identity authentication and has a broad application prospects in shopping, criminals recognition and smart home.
